What is AWS WAF?

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules that allow, 
block, or monitor (count) web requests based on conditions that you define.

How does AWS WAF block or allow traffic?

As the underlying service receives requests for your web sites, it forwards those requests to AWS WAF for inspection against your rules.

Can I use AWS WAF to protect web sites not hosted in AWS?

Yes, AWS WAF is integrated with Amazon CloudFront, which supports custom origins outside of AWS.

Which types of attacks can AWS WAF help me to stop?

AWS WAF helps protects your website from common attack techniques like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 
In addition, you can create rules that can block or rate-limit traffic from specific user-agents.

Which bot mitigation capabilities are available with AWS WAF?
AWS WAF Bot Control gives you visibility and control over common and pervasive bot traffic to your applications. With Bot Control, you can easily monitor, block, or rate-limit pervasive bots, such as scrapers, scanners, and crawlers, and you can allow common bots, such as status monitors and search engines.

Does AWS WAF support IPv6?
Yes, support for IPv6 allows the AWS WAF to inspect HTTP/S requests coming from both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.
